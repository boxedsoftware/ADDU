ACTIVE DIRECTORY USER PROFILE DATA USAGE
=============================================
This essential utility provides the ability to query a directory and return all sub-directory sizes.
Very helpful since Microsoft Active Directory does not provide an inbuilt feature to display user roaming
profile sizes.

Features:
------------
-Ability to query network shared directories (must have directory permissions)
-Ability to query local directories (local on the web server that is)
-Ability to export the list generated as a MS Excel file
-Quick statistics report: Total folders, total space usage, folders over 500MB, folders over 1GB, errors returned
-Corresponding icon images
-Table on-cursor highlight
-Help page

Programmed using:
--------------------
-PHP5
-Javascript
-JQuery 1.7.1
-HTML
-CSS

To run this utility, you will need a PHP enabled web-server (IIS, APACHE, etc.). Simply copy the files across and run!
Note: Make sure you run the web server via an administrator account otherwise you will have errors querying folders - 
remember you need directory permissions.
